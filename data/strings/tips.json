Youâ€™ve got a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIt may seem like a bit of a mess, but you should count your lucky stars: you havenâ€™t been carved up for spare parts by some pirate! On a related note, you are going to need credits to put toward interest on the Recovery Installment Plan which has already been attached to your genecode, so letâ€™s introduce the thought that you may indeed wish to sell a kidney, most of your liver, or a surprising amount of skin with very little harm to normal biological function â€“ provided you pass the rad screening, of course. You donâ€™t have to answer now, weâ€™ll give you a bit to think it over.\n\nIn the meantime, weâ€™ve prepared a little primer to help catch you up on whatâ€™s been going on in the local volume. Your eye movements will trigger text navigation so you donâ€™t have to move your variably atrophied limbs â€“ hope you didnâ€™t go with the cheap model cryotank! Sit back, and please pay attention. We have good statistics which demonstrate that a steady grounding in the present historical context helps cryo-recovered subjects re-integrate with society in 78.3% of cases.\n\nhulk\n\n\n \n\nIn The Beginning\n\n'Anything that happened before interstellar civilization is only interesting to weird old scholars and Luddics who go on about the sins of this and that. I wonâ€™t waste your time, weâ€™ll jump right over to the good stuff.'\n\nThe Hopeless Foolâ€™s Holo History part 1 (narration by the author)\n\nThe Interstellar Diaspora\n\n'Then, in fits and starts, humanity lifted itself on flimsy hand-engineered craft set atop crude explosives. In the planets and moons above they found unimagined wealth, and with it built the first cities and ships worthy of those names. They looked out to the stars beyond and wondered what could be there and who would be the first to go.\n\nOld Earth cast out its dissidents, its unruly dreamers, its fanatics, and its utopian ideologues in those first leaking starships to build societies fitting their dreams â€“ and sometimes their nightmares. The era of the sub-FTL expansion to the first neighbouring star systems is rife with legend and half-truth, but those insular cultures scattered and mutated, cut off from Old Earth, and created a flowering of unique worlds.'\n\nThe Reenactorâ€™s Visual Guide to Pre-FTL Culture (TriMedia Store)\n\nSol System colonized\nDevelopment of first starships, cryosleep technology\nFirst wave of sub-FTL autonomous probes, sporeships, seedships dispatched (none of which have reached the Persean Sector)\nThe Hyperspace Expansion\n\n'The Luddics make a great fuss about the significance of the devastation of Old Earth. This author will concede that, like stories of the first rockets to escape Old Earthâ€™s gravity, it possesses the mythological resonance of a sort of threshold of history. It allows one to point and say that yes, right then is when it all changed. Certain historians describe this event as an end to the collective childhood of humanity, though a less romantic perspective might reason that the majority of human population and industry was almost certainly off-world and increasingly out-of-system anyway. The Old Earth was just a symbol by then anyway. It is nonetheless a fitting turning point with which to understand the shape of human civilization to come.'\n\nAyomide Callistoâ€™s Commentaries Vol. III (Galatia Academy Publishing)\n\nFTL technology developed\nEarth devastated\nFirst development of true interstellar polities\nSecond wave of FTL-equipped probes, sporeships, seedships dispatched (hailing from various polities)\nThe Gate System and the Human Domain\n\n'Nothing was restrained that could be imagined; those journeys of years through the holy void were eluded by trespass into hyperspace. The KL Device was not the first human sin against Godâ€™s law of causality, but it was the greatest, for it opened wide the unholy road. The vast domain of Humanity was united in this molochian pact: The Gate-haulers opened the way to each colonized system then, by pen or by sword, the onslaught of the Domainâ€™s vast armada subjugated each world.\n\nThe far end of cycles of war and occupation found the edge of the colonized Hyperspace Expanse. But this was not enough for the Domain, driven as it was by a spirit of conquest to never be sated. This infernal mechanization lusted on for celestial spheres beyond, and beyond, and beyond; it would never stop devouring Godâ€™s creation.\n\nHumanity was thence scattered abroad upon the face of the galaxy, speaking one tongue, united by the demon Gates in one body of worldly law. But we had forgotten the laws of God, mightier than any fusion lance. God would remind humanity of its place in this universe.'\n\nThe Sermons of Caprican Spaceborn (Brassica Paperwrights, Gilead)\n\nactive_gate\n\nGate system developed\nUnitary hegemony forms on basis of Gate technology: The Human Domain\nDomain dominates human-colonized space\nDomain expands using combination of Gate system and FTL\nThird wave of autonomous exploration motherships, sporeships, etc. dispatched. Includes the Gate Haulers of legend, which spread nodes of the Gate network.\nThe Persean Sector Pre-Collapse\n\n'The Luddic faithful contemplate/perform a series of scenes which represent the life and death of the Prophet Ludd. This 'spiritual road' is often a literal traversal of space past a number of shrines, dioramas, or live re-enactings, the scale of which may vary wildly depending on the intended scope of the ritual. The scenes are as follows:\n\nThe Innocence: The birth of the one-who-will-become-Ludd. Themes of innocence, connection the humanity pre-sin. It is important that the Luddics make no record of any personal characteristics of their prophet and in so emphasize the-one-who-would-become-Luddâ€™s oneness with the experience of all humanity. This allows any individual to put themselves into the role of Ludd in the stations of the Path, as subject or observer.\nThe Witnessing: The one-who-will-become-Ludd leaves a sheltered existence and witnesses the misery of the world. Figures encountered include some combination of: a starving child ignored in the street, a plant growing from a crack in the deck-plates, a radiation-burned veteran abandoned by the Armada, a penniless merchant used by his partners, a world allowed to choke on ash by those who care only for the moment, a scholar who found truth scorned by the prideful, a criminal condemned despite her repentance, etc.\nThe Ecstasy: In which the despairing one-who-will-become-Ludd is touched by the spirit of God and thereafter adopts the Ludd persona to bring the divine message to humanity\nThe Teaching: In which Ludd starts spiritual 'clubs' for those who 'seek galactic redemption'. \nThe First Persecution: In which Ludd is mocked, then physically attacked, then hidden from prosecution by followers.\nThe Exodus: In which Ludd is given a vision by God of a promised land, and leads the faithful to settle in the Persean Sector\nThe Blooming: In which the faithful teach the industrial-terraformers how to shepherd the spirit of the land to create a new paradise. \nThe Second Persecution: In which the followers of Ludd again face hardship and persecution at the hands of authorities in the Persean Sector.\nThe Peacemaker: In which Ludd protects one of the mob who had attacked the faithful from a revenge-attack by followers and in doing so is revealed to authorities\nThe Arrest: In which Ludd is arrested by Domain authorities; the faithful are willing to fight, but again Ludd asks them to lay down their arms\nThe Trial: In which Ludd is condemned to die by the Domain Sector-leader.\nThe Discontinuity: In which Ludd enters the Gate system and is taken by God; the Gates are sealed in the promise of redemption for humanity.'\nAn Unbelievers Introduction to the Luddic Faith (TriMedia Store)\n\nThe Collapse\n\n'Fact: Giant fleets of AI warships donâ€™t just show up out of no-where and they donâ€™t just happen to be concentrated in the kinds of numbers we saw in the First AI War in one backwater sector on the Domainâ€™s frontier. Trust me, anyone who examines the facts can see that Tri-Tachyon was prepared to make a move. Some would say they even instigated the Collapse using some kind of super-AI. Is it a coincidence that the Collapse happened just as Domain Battlegroup VI was rotated out of the Sector with Battlegroup XIV not yet arrived? I donâ€™t think so, buddy. The AI mastermind controlling Tri-Tachyon had this all planned out, including the so-called Luddic Church psy-ops project to doubly weaken Domain authority. Facts donâ€™t lie.'\n\nTri-Truth: The AI Plot Behind The Collapse (TriMedia Store)\n\nThe Gate Network instantly ceases to operate within volume of information available to human civilization in the Persean Sector.\nThis collapse is allegedly concurrent with the transfer of a prisoner named 'Ludd' via Gate Network. The veracity of this claim is much disputed.\n\nBattlegroup XIV, including elements of 200th Legion (disgraced after a series of mutinies while deployed against rebels), was cut off from the Gate Network at a transfer point in vicinity of Persean Sector. Enacts network failure protocol: most of the crew is put into emergency cryosleep, many units jury-rigged, and the ships make the hyperspace journey toward the closest civilized volume. Civilian ships and outposts encountered en-route are stripped of fuel and supplies. Many core fleet elements must be mothballed or abandoned.\n\nRemains of various megacorps are cut off in the Persean Sector. Some are established and flexible enough to rebuild a command hierarchy (Tri-Tachyon, Ko Combine, HG Autofab, Bhilai Space Group). Others collapse as local oligarchs carve out fiefdoms, workers abandon their posts, or other polities seize assets; examples include Eridani-Utopia, Altair Exotech, Fabrique Orbitale, Interstellar Dynamics, and others.\nEarly Post-Collapse (period of roughly c+00 to c+100)\n\nc+5 â€“ Refugees from terraforming collapse on Maxios settle outer Magec system\n\nc+8 â€“ Formation of Church of Galactic Redemption\n\nThe Church of Galactic Redemption arose out of a compromise between a handful of the largest sects of faithful who agreed that worldly organizations were necessary to uphold the teachings of Ludd. The Knights of Ludd were formed as a monastic military branch of the Church intended to temper secular wrath with spiritual virtue.\n\nMany sects remain outside the official Church including the infamous loosely associated 'Luddic Path'.\n\nluddic_congregation\n\ncirca c+48 â€“ XIV Battlegroup arrives in Persean Sector\n\nXIV Battlegroup claims military authority to seize supplies necessary for its operation.\n\ncirca c+49 â€“ XIV Battlegroup enacts a diktat of hegemony\n\n'The Hegemony stands for the overriding cause of the restoration of the Domain and therefore stability, peace, and prosperity for all humanity in the galaxy. This must come first before any other niceties of civilized life. Officers, crew, citizens â€“ the survival of humanity is at stake! It is only the discipline of the Hegemony military that creates a space on our precious protected worlds where some semblance of 'normalcy' can be found. Anything that threatens this cause must be neutralized by the power of the Hegemony.'\n\nAddress to the Assembly, first High Hegemon Kali Molina\n\nIn cooperation with 'native elements', a legal framework is laid for the polity known as the Hegemony and is declared a successor to Domain authority in a ceremony held on Eventide.\n\nearly c+82.10 â€“ Destruction of Mairaath by Pather terrorists\n\n'What remains is a charred and broken landscape, the carefully nurtured weather patterns of the great Mayasuran terraforming cabal transformed into nightmarish storms that circle the globe, stirring the ashes of a murdered world.'\n\n(selection from anonymous Hegemony warrant officerâ€™s AAR submitted to Hegemony archives)\n\nmairaath\n\nc+82.10.22 â€“ The Last Hurrah (mission)\n\nHegemony attacks Mayasurian Navy. Hegemony is victorious and takes control of Mayasura system.\n\nFigures involved:\n\n Commodore Jensulte of Hegemony\ncirca c+83 â€“ Formation of the Persean League\n\ncrest_persean_league'Make no mistake, the Persean League is not egalitarian, it does not protect individual freedom. Their goal is only the freedom of their member polities as entities unto themselves â€“ this is the freedom of the Kazeron oligarchs to enslave the weak, to exploit the masses, to run an archipelago of petty dictatorships against coordinated mass action of the free peoples of the Sector!'\n\nHow to Identify and Classify Antis, Hegemony Ministry of Information FactNet\n\n(quotation of unauthorized hyperwave dispatch from suspected ARC cell propagandist)\n\nIn response to the Hegemony, a loose alliance of major worlds declares itself the Persean League to uphold independent sovereignty\n\ncirca c+84 â€“ Tri-Tachyon Corporation deploys AI warfleets\n\nDue to lack of Domain technology controls and rising tension in the Persean Sector, Tri-Tachyon acts with free hand to deploy AI warfleets developed in secret in various systems on the fringe of the Core Worlds.\n\nThe First AI War\n\nc+89-95 â€“ The First AI War\n\nHegemony declares intent to enforce Domain-era restrictions on AI development against Tri-Tachyon. The Persean League sides with Tri-Tachyon, the Luddic Church sides with the Hegemony. War engulfs the Sector.\n\nTerms of surrender involve acceptance of technological inspection by Hegemony (with support of Luddic Church). Much of the irreplaceable XIV Battlegroup matÃ©riel was destroyed in this war. Similarly, much of Tri-Tachyonâ€™s infrastructure is devastated â€“ or dismantled in the post-war settlement.\n\nharry\n\nc+95-107 â€“ Joint Hegemony/Knights of Ludd fleet operations sweep autonomous AI from fringe systems until partnership agreement breaks down.\n\nc+107 â€“ High Hegemon declares victory over the AI threat.\n\nAI War Interbellum\n\nc+148 â€“ Mazalot regime in Zagan toppled by Luddic revolution\n\nLeague world of Mazalot is overthrown by Luddic majority population\n\nc+153.08.12 â€“ Coral Nebula (mission)\n\nPersean League sends fleet to intervene in Luddic revolution in Zagan system. Successfully defeats Knights of Ludd / Pather fleet.\n\n Involved:\n\nNavarch Mars Kato of Kazeron, of the Persean League\ncirca c+160â€™s â€“ Invasion of sector by the Warlord Loke\n\nRogue fleet of former Domain military warships under command of Onesimos Loke enters Persean Sector after raiding fringe worlds. Scores major victory by catching Hegemony taskforce unaware in Penelopeâ€™s Star.\n\nc+160 â€“ Colonel Kanta turns traitor in Magec\n\nOriginally a Hegemony logistics officer, Colonel Kanta cuts a deal with Loke to turn the Hegemony base in Guayotaâ€™s Disk â€“ and its arsenal â€“ over to the pirate warlord.\n\nc+160 â€“ Andrada defeats Warlord Loke\n\nThe young Andrada\nThe young Andrada\n\nMuch glory earned by the young and upcoming Hegemony officer Andrada in the Battle of Maxios. Hegemony policy promotes hero-worship as means to unify population.\n\nInvolved:\n\nWarlord Loke\nPhillip Andrada\nc+160 â€“ Colonel Kanta declares herself successor to Warlord Loke\n\nOnce itâ€™s clear how the tides are turning, Colonel Kanta turns again, spaces the Loke loyalists left on her station, and sets herself up as a pirate Warlord over the remains of Lokeâ€™s fleet. Local politics (and heavy weapons) make it inconvenient for the Hegemony to clean out her operation. She proceeds to build alliances and puts herself at the head of a dynasty of pirates and organized crime spread throughout the local systems.\n\n Involved:\n\nWarlord Kanta\nc+180 â€“ Beginning of Askonia Crisis\n\nCivil war breaks out in Askonia system. Ostensibly over domestic issues, flashpoint occurs around Persean League membership consideration, but much outside interference as well.\n\nc+181 â€“ Hegemony intervention in Askonia\n\nAskonia is powerful independent system considering League membership to shore up domestic support in face of ongoing civil war. Hegemony moves to counter expansion of the Persean League by intervening.\n\nInvolved\n\nAdmiral Phillip Andrada of the Hegemony\nc+181 â€“ World of Opis is destroyed, Andrada takes Sindria, declares Sindrian Diktat\n\n'The captain stood up from his chair and asked again that it was a PK deployed against Opis. The junior lieutenant on sensors confirmed, and the captain asked once more, like he was angry at the fact of it. It was still true. In one quick motion the old man pulls his sidearm and shoots himself in the head, right there, blam. Everyone on the bridge was stunned for a moment, felt like forever with just the small arms alarm going. Then shouting, and some kind of bomb went off, I think, and there was more gunfire; CP arcs across the holotank. I remember that; the beams sparkled through the smoke. It was chaos.'\n\nAudio report from survivor of the HSS Potentate mutiny, Hegemony Naval Archives, Eventide\n\nopis\n\nThe moon Opis, capital and population center of the Askonia polity, is destroyed by a Planet Killer. Andrada blames rebels, rebels blame Andrada, other rebels blame each other, others blame outside agents.\n\nThe Hegemony executive council considers Andradaâ€™s actions erratic and ill-judged, issuing a recall order which he ignores, declaring it 'weak-willed treason'.\n\nPhillip Andrada starts purges throughout Askonia system, declares himself executor-for-life aka Diktat Executor over new polity formed from the Hegemony intervention fleet.\n\nMost of the Hegemony task force declares for Andrada â€“ Hero of the Battle of Maxios â€“ while a minority remains loyal to Hegemony and a smaller minority joins the Askonian rebels. A chaotic battle breaks out in the Hegemony armada in orbit around Sindria with fighting both in ship corridors and between ships of the Hegemony fleet.\n\nInvolved\n\nPhillip Andrada, leader of the Sindrian Diktat, 'The Lion of Sindria'\nThe Second AI War\n\n'The Second AI War saw five terrible cycles of war between Tri-Tachyon and the Hegemony with rising stakes as the conflict proceeded. As before, the Luddic Church tended to back the Hegemony while the Persean League tended to back Tri-Tachyon, though neither openly or enthusiastically. The war resulted in a greatly weakened Tri-Tachyon Corporation, though the personal power of Artemisia Sun was vastly increased within Tri-Tachyon due to her ouster just before and return just after the greatest defeat of the war.
